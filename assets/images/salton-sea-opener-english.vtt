00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.857
The Salton Sea is a place
of extraordinary beauty —

2
00:00:02.857 --> 00:00:04.700
an exceptional challenge.

3
00:00:05.757 --> 00:00:09.343
Here, indigenous, immigrant, 
and farmworker communities

4
00:00:09.343 --> 00:00:12.136
have built the backbone of
California's prosperity. 

5
00:00:12.136 --> 00:00:14.882
They grow the food;
they sustain the economy.

6
00:00:14.907 --> 00:00:18.129
Yet, for decades, their region
has been left behind.

7
00:00:18.843 --> 00:00:21.686
The story told about this place
is often one of division.

8
00:00:21.686 --> 00:00:23.371
But, that's a false narrative.

9
00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:26.033
Across Riverside and Imperial Counties, 

10
00:00:26.033 --> 00:00:29.710
across tribes, non-profits, and 
local governments,

11
00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.639
a different truth is taking shape.

12
00:00:32.639 --> 00:00:34.357
From resilience, centers —

13
00:00:34.357 --> 00:00:37.029
in Coachella and Calipatria...

14
00:00:37.029 --> 00:00:39.839
To trails connecting shores to cities. 

15
00:00:40.643 --> 00:00:44.429
To a united call for climate and 
infrastructure investment. 

16
00:00:44.429 --> 00:00:47.300
The Salton Sea region is rising together.

17
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.693
This is more than a place.

18
00:00:49.693 --> 00:00:51.571
It is a united region, 

19
00:00:51.571 --> 00:00:53.651
deserving of more.

20
00:00:53.851 --> 00:00:57.243
And together, we are turning
vision into action.
